# Module-6-Weather-Dashboard

This repository is my sixth challenge of many to complete within the UofT coding bootcamp I'm taking part of. 
The assignment is to create a Weather Dashboard to meet the assignment's Acceptance Criteria.
The first part of this is the User Story which is as follows:

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## To Put It Simply

The assignment is to create a Weather Dashboard which uses the open weather api to gather data for a current and 5 day forecast, while also displaying a UV index which changes color based on how severe it is, as well as adding any previously searched city into local storage to load as a button for later searches
